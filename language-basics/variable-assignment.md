# Variable Assignment

In R, there are primarily three assignment operators

1. `<-`
2. `=`
3. `->`

## The `<-` Operator

This is the most common assignment operator in `R` and is preferred for variable assignments.

### Variable Assignment

```r
x <- 10
message <- "Hello, R!"
```

### Vector Assignment

```r
vec <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```

### Dataframe Assignment

```r
df <- data.frame(
  name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"),
  age = c(25, 30, 35)
)
```
